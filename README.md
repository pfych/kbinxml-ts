# kbinxml-ts
A KbinXML implementation in Typescript.

##***CURRENTLY NOT FUNCTIONAL***

I've wanted to know how kbin works and what better way than to write a parser and generator in a programming language I know and love, Typescript.

Basing a lot of this work off of the original [kbinxml implementation](https://github.com/mon/kbinxm) as well as the [kbinxml-rs implementation](https://github.com/mbilker/kbinxml-rs).

This project will eventually merge into [IIDX-Lambda](https://github.com/Puffycheeses/iidx-lambda)
